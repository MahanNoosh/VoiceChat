# üé§ VoiceChat ‚Äì Real-Time Voice Communication Platform

## Project Overview
VoiceChat is a **real-time voice communication application** that I built to stay connected with friends across different countries. Many existing platforms (like Telegram or Zoom) have limitations: group calls can be tricky, some platforms are restricted in certain countries, and peer-to-peer calls are often cumbersome. VoiceChat solves these issues by providing a lightweight, private platform for **direct, low-latency audio communication**.  

While currently used mainly by me and my friends, the platform is designed so that anyone can **host it themselves on a cloud platform** or a personal server and use it just like we do. This is primarily intended for private use by small groups.  

## Key Features
- **üéß Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Audio:** Users communicate directly via WebRTC for minimal delay.  
- **‚ö° Signaling Server:** Backend manages connections, user sessions, and room handling.  
- **üåê Cross-Browser Support:** Compatible with all modern browsers.  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Simple, Intuitive UI:** Designed for easy and quick use by a small group.  
- **üîí Secure Connections:** Audio streams are handled safely without unnecessary data exposure.  

## Technologies
- **WebRTC** ‚Äì Peer-to-peer audio streaming  
- **Node.js & Express** ‚Äì Backend signaling server  
- **Socket.io** ‚Äì Real-time messaging and signaling  
- **JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3** ‚Äì Frontend development  

## Why I Built It
- To **stay connected with friends across countries**, bypassing restrictions of existing platforms.  
- To **experiment with real-time communications and full-stack integration**.  
- To **learn by solving real-world problems** like low-latency streaming, session management, and cross-browser compatibility.  
- To provide a **flexible platform** that others can host themselves if desired.  

## Professional Highlights
- Designed and implemented a **signaling server** for efficient peer connections.  
- Leveraged **WebRTC** for direct audio streaming.  
- Built a **responsive, cross-browser frontend** focused on user experience.  
- Applied problem-solving to **latency, session handling, and private networking** challenges.  

## Usage
This platform is **private**, primarily used by me and my friends. Anyone who wishes to use it must **host it themselves** on a cloud service. It demonstrates a **working prototype of a fully functional real-time voice chat system**.
